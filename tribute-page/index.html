                    <span style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Shree Krishna,</span>
                    a central figure in Hinduism, is
                    revered as the eighth avatar of Bhagwan Shree Vishnu. He was born in Mathura and raised in
                    Vrindavan, India.
                    Krishna's life, filled with divine leelas (miracles) and teachings, is recounted in Hindu scriptures
                    like the Bhagavad Gita and the Mahabharata. He played a pivotal role in the Kurukshetra War, where
                    he
                    served as a charioteer and spiritual guide to Arjuna, imparting profound wisdom on duty,
                    righteousness,
                    and devotion. Krishna is often depicted as a blue-skinned deity playing the flute, symbolizing love,
                    joy, and the union of the individual soul with the divine. He is also adorned with a peacock feather
                    on his head and holds a flute in his hands.

                            prayers, young Lord Krishna, the ruler of Gokula, playfully bound to a wooden grinding
                            mortar by Mother Yashoda, graced them with a smile. He acknowledged that He was aware of how
                            His devoted Narada Muni had saved them from their pride, born of their extraordinary beauty
                            and divine heritage. Their encounter with Narada had liberated them from potential
                            damnation.

                            During the Kurukshetra War, Lord Krishna bestowed a divine vision, known as Vishvarupa or
                            the Universal Form, upon Arjuna. As Arjuna stood on the battlefield filled with doubt and
                            moral dilemma, Krishna revealed his cosmic, multifaceted form.

                <h2>Key Lessons from Bhagavad Gita</h2>
                <hr style="width: 20%; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">Live in the present</strong> <br>
                <p>This is one of the most important lessons kids can learn from Krishna. Even though Krishna focuses on and plans for the future, he never fails to live in the present. He practised mindfulness, the act of focusing and living in the moment instead of worrying about the past or the future. This skill helps one make memories and live a less stressful life. 
                </p></li>

                <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">To be dutiful</strong> <br>
                <p>TDespite being the Lord of the universe, Krishna never shied away from his duties. It is one of the things he is well-known for. Krishna stressed the importance of completing your duties by yourself. He taught people to fulfil their duties without focusing on the outcome. He willed people to enjoy the journey rather than be driven by the results.
                </p></li>

                <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">Never give up on what you love</strong> <br>
                <p>Even though he was burdened with saving the kingdom, being a good king, and answering his devotee’s every prayer, Krishna always made time for what he loved. Krishna’s love for his flute and music is not surprising to anyone who has read about him. Krishna never stopped pursuing his love for music and it brought him peace even in the midst of a war. Regardless of what is going on in your life, it is always important to spare time for the things you love.
                </p></li>

                <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">Be humble</strong> <br>
                <p>One would expect the Lord of the universe to be haughty or above all but that is never the way Krishna behaved. He always stayed humble and respected his elders. This character trait made him loveable and earned him devotees from all over the world. Krishna showed that you do not win over people by power but you win them over by being kind and showing everyone respect.
                </p></li>

                <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">Sometimes sacrifice is necessary</strong><br>
                <p>Krishna had to make some tough decisions during the battle of Kurukshetra including making some sacrifices to win the battle. Sometimes, life demands sacrifices, be it getting out of your comfort zone or putting your ego second. In order to succeed in life, you should be able to sacrifice and compromise at times for the bigger picture. 
                </p></li>

                <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">Everyone deserves respect</strong> <br>
                    <p>Krishna respected every person, animal, or living being he encountered, He believed that everyone deserves respect regardless of their societal status or job. Spiritually, we are all the same and Krishna showed us that by treating everyone with the same respect.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">The importance of friendship</strong> <br>
                    <p>Krishna valued his friendships greatly which is evident by his love for his childhood friend Sudhama. When Krishna found out that Sudhama was struggling to put food on the table, he gifted him with shelter, food, and luxury. This can teach kids a lesson or two about being loyal to our friends or being there for them in their time of need.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">Happiness does not come from materialistic things</strong><br>
                    <p>This is one of the most imperative lessons you can teach your child. Krishna always preached about finding happiness within oneself as opposed to relying on other people or materialistic things. While a new toy or a video game might put a smile on your child’s face, it is temporary. True happiness lies in the little things in life and the sooner your children realise that, the happier they will be.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">Everything happens for a reason</strong><br>
                    <p>Krishna was a big believer in fate and destiny. While one should not always rely on fate, it helps to think that behind everything, there is a reason. Whether good or bad, everything happens for a reason. The key lies in staying calm and trusting yourself and the universe.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><strong style="color: #003a6e; font-size: 20px;">Unconditional love is the key</strong> <br>
                    <p>Everything Krishna did was fuelled by unconditional love. His kindness, humility, and affection for people around him were because of his unconditional love. Regardless of what curveball life throws at you, if you lead by love, you will never fail.
                    </p></li>
